### AI / Internet Source Disclosure
- **Tool used:** ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI, October 2025)  
- **Purpose:** Used to verify correct method signatures and formatting for overloaded `area()` methods.  
- **Prompt:** *"How can I implement a Java program with multiple overloaded methods that calculate areas of different shapes while validating for negative or zero dimensions?"*
- **AI Answer (Excerpt):** *"Use four overloaded methods named `area()`: one for a circle with a double radius, one for a rectangle with two doubles, one for a triangle with two ints, and one for a square with a single int. Each should throw `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid values."*
- **Adaption:** I adapted this structure and added my own exception handling and print formatting in Eclipse.
